# touchpad-enable-disable
simple script to enable or disable Touchpad on linux

it is pretty annoying when you are typing and accidentally you touch the Touchpad and your cursor goes to another line 

so i created this very simple script to disable/enable it

# how to

first you need to make this script executable
```
chmod +x touchpad.sh
```

after that you can just run the following line to disable it

```
./touchpad.sh 0
```

and to enable it you can just run

```
./touchpad.sh
```
