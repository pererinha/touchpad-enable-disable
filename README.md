# touchpad-enable-disable
simple script to enable or disable Touchpad on linux

it is pretty annoying when you are typing and accidentally you touch the Touchpad (or when your cat 🐈 deliberately touches it) and your cursor goes to another line 

so i created this very simple script to disable/enable it

# how to

first you need to make this script executable
```
chmod +x touchpad.sh
```

after that you can just run the following line to disable it

```
./touchpad.sh 0
```

and to enable it you can just run

```
./touchpad.sh
```
